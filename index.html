    Hey there! I'm Chris...
  </span>
</h1>
<p>
  ...a junior at <a href="https://berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> studying Computer Science and Molecular Biology. This summer, I'm building
  a MongoDB integration for <a href="https://github.com/rdkit">rdkit</a>,
  an open-source chemoinformatics platform, as part of
  <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a>.
  I'm also helping to teach
  <a href="https://cs61bl.org/su20/">CS61BL: Data Structures</a>.
</p>
<p>
  My larger aim is to improve healthcare with technology. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made it abundantly clear
  that the healthcare sector is underfunded and underprepared, whether financially, logistically, or medically.
  The pandemic has also made clear that new technology can drastically improve resource allocation and patient outcomes.
  More generally, the ethos of the technology sector rewards reasonable risk and encourages disruption, things
  twice needed in an overburdened, conservative market.
</p>
<p>
  I'm still figuring out how where I stand in this picture, whether it's identifying investments, working in a lab, or
  doing product development. Perhaps I'll end up doing something outside of healthcareâ€”there's a lot of other good to do.
  For now though, I'm learning, working, eating, sleeping, running a lot, and writing a little. You'll find some of the last on this site.

  <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid;">What I've Done So Far
  </span>
</h2>


    While leading projects with <a href="https://neurotech.berkeley.edu">Neurotech@Berkeley</a> and
    <a href="https://phoenix.berkeley.edu">Phoenix Consulting Group</a>, I got exposure to digital health products, data-driven health policy, brain computer-interfacing, and using holography for imaging.
    Especially in healthcare, there's limitless possibility. We're like the Seahawks at the 1-yard line.
    All we have to do is make the right play.

    <p>
      Outside of tech and healthcare, I've spent some time selling an <a href="https://choco.com">app</a>
      to chefs in Chicago and <a href="http://www.peerprivatelessons.org/">advocating for access</a>
      to music lessons. These days, I spend a lot of time running and writing, some of the latter on this site.
