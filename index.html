    Hey there! I'm Chris...
  </span>
</h2>
<p>
  ...a junior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Biochemistry. I spend my time thinking about and working on improving society with tech.
  Next summer, I'll be at Datavant, a startup that aims to de-silo healthcare data.
</p>
<p>In the past, I've worked on cheminformatics software, taught CS classes, sold a sustainability app door to door in Chicago and built a technical consulting group. 
  My "work" is my biggest passion, but I also love spending time outdoors, cooking, and music of all kinds.

  When I remember to update it, this site serves a hub for projects and teaching. For the most part, however, it's a repository for infrequent blog posts. Topics vary
  from technical recaps to random musing. Recently, I've been doing a lot of thinking about religion.
