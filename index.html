    Hey there! I'm Chris...
  </span>
</h1>
<p>
  ...a junior at <a class=fancy-underline href="https://berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> studying Computer Science and Molecular Biology. This summer, I'm building
  a MongoDB integration for <a class=fancy-underline href="https://github.com/rdkit">rdkit</a>,
  an open-source cheminformatics platform, as part of
  <a class=fancy-underline href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a>.
  I'm also helping to teach
  <a class=fancy-underline href="https://cs61bl.org/su20/">CS61BL: Data Structures</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I've a pretty eclectic background, having sold an app door to door in Chicago,
  built a technical consulting group, and worked on
  projects with the CMO of Logitech and CIO of the American Red Cross. Recently I've been
  investigating healthcare, focusing on what technology I can help build to improve pricing,
  care, and resource allocation.
</p>
<p>
  One thing's for sureâ€”there's a lot of good to do, no one person
  has all the answers, and we grow by sharing knowledge. Would love to chat with you
  about a read, an uptake, or anything interesting at all!

  <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid;">What I've Done So Far
  </span>
</h2>


    While leading projects with <a href="https://neurotech.berkeley.edu">Neurotech@Berkeley</a> and
    <a href="https://phoenix.berkeley.edu">Phoenix Consulting Group</a>, I got exposure to digital health products, data-driven health policy, brain computer-interfacing, and using holography for imaging.
    Especially in healthcare, there's limitless possibility. We're like the Seahawks at the 1-yard line.
    All we have to do is make the right play.

    <p>
      Outside of tech and healthcare, I've spent some time selling an <a href="https://choco.com">app</a>
      to chefs in Chicago and <a href="http://www.peerprivatelessons.org/">advocating for access</a>
      to music lessons. These days, I spend a lot of time running and writing, some of the latter on this site.
