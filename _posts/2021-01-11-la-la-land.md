I first watched *La La Land* in 2016. We drove to the theater to see it, and I remember arguing with my parents on the way back about its promotion of "crazy" artistry. The argument frustrated me, mostly because my real thoughts were that *La La Land* felt potentially autobiographical in an imaginary sort of way. I was a decent violinist with half-baked dreams of a musical career. But of course, I couldn't say that to my parents: they knew I knew and I knew they knew that I'd never go to music school. 

I also remember being powerfully affected—almost sucked in—by the film's atmosphere. From its first song to its Epilogue, *La La Land* is a fever dream of starts and partings. In other words, it's alive with hope and melancholy. Even jazz, its in-world artistic motif, is the most temporary of art forms: new every time but gone after every performance. The film was one step in removing a sense of permanence. At 16, I found that exciting and unsettling. 

Last weekend, I watched *La La Land* seriously for the first time since then. Instead of a theater, my three housemates and I perched on kitchen chairs in a bedroom; I think our legs collectively occupied the entire floorspace. We had a plate of homemade sweet potato fries and a 4K monitor looted from an internship.

What we take away from movies is a function of both film and watcher, and this time was no exception. *La La Land* remains the same film but since 2016, I've traveled, learned, loved, seen death and avoided it. I now play on a $100 keyboard in my living room, not Carnegie Hall, and feel none the worse. 

So in contrast to the abstract way I saw *La La Land* in 2016, I saw it last weekend through a critical eye. I could appreciate Damien Chazelle behind the camera and Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling in front of it. I could see the intentionality behind the major-minor key switches and laugh at the lackluster choreography. 

Mostly, however, I noticed how Chazelle examines the choice between success and people. His previous film, *Whiplash*, features a protagonist who unequivocably chooses success. Mia and Sebastian, however, struggle with the choice for most of the film. While their individual character growth is almost entirely dependent on career success, neither can really grow their career without the other's support.

In the end, Mia and Sebastian choose success. EXT: The Park Bench, daytime: all of Stone and Gosling's formidable chemistry is on display. There're no tearjerkers here; it's a nice modern breakup. "We'll just have to wait and see," they say. Chazelle screws with our hearts a little in the fantasy epilogue, but the end result is the same: they could have been together only if one of them had given up their dream.

Romantic stories—or all stories, really—are most compelling when their conflicts are realistic. We identify with the characters, relate to their motives, feel their struggles. We project our own choices into the movie and vice versa and wonder how things could have turned out had we chosen differently.

*La La Land*'s choice between success and people feels potentially autobiographical again, albeit in a far more realistic way. In real life, the choice isn't just between success and romantic relationships. We also invest time in family, close friends, and close communities. Some even consider their commitments to religious or other nonprofit work.

In terms of time, many of my friends and I have all confronted this choice and already chosen. We're passionate about the work we do and appreciate that we support each other in doing it. As much as I chose to refocus on the people in my life this past semester, I'm still easily an workaholic. Spikeball with the housemates feels like a luxury. To some extent, I'm lucky that the geographic confines and casual "working" clubs of college yield friendships.

But college and its free friendships are coming to a close. As success would have it, my friends and I will soon have opportunity to scatter to the four corners of the globe (or more accurately, New York, SF, Austin, or Boston). We'll see each other once a year—maybe less. The question then becomes how much the people around us factor into our decisions to chase job offers. 

Again, many have already chosen. My big opted to work in Cupertino to stay near her family. My roommate is graduating early, moving up and out for an apartment in New York. For my big, I imagine the decision wasn't overly difficult. A stint at big tech is hardly a pause in her career. But my roommate has been cajoling his girlfriend to move with him. Suppose she got a dream offer in the Bay Area. Would she give it up? Would they try for long distance? Break up like Mia and Sebastian?

I've seen Facebook posts in Subtle Asian Networking that wrestle with this question, and commenters rarely advise giving up career. They say that investing in ourselves is far safer and far more satisfying. This advice strikes me as ...extremely capitalistic. It definitely fits our societal mold. Dating is a numbers game, right?

I see their point, but I also think they miss another: good relationships are *about* choosing somebody else's interests over a few of our own—and we don't feel grudging about it. I'm happy to sacrifice more for my family than my close friends, and my close friends more so than not-so-close friends. To some extent, I feel that if Mia and Sebastian loved each other so much, Sebastian could have put off opening his club for a few years. If my roommate and his girlfriend are serious about each other, he should probably consider staying in SF to stay near her. I know that it's a choice I'd struggle with.

In the end, for all its riot of color and sound, irrepressibly singable songs, LA charms, and melancholy airs, *La La Land* ends with a nod from one past lover to another. It's acknowledgement and catharsis packed in 10 seconds of staring at Ryan Gosling's ludicrously long strand of hair. The final lesson of *La La Land*, Chazelle seems to say, is that things turn out ok, so stop worrying about your career and your choices and go live them. What am I tripping for? Tomorrow's another day of sun.

*October-ish, 2020. Touched up in January 2021.*
