title: Three Great Sandwiches
---
Last week, I called a friend from home. We were talking about food, and I must've given her an earful of all the good food I'd eaten in Berkeley or something. Stop talking, she said. I'm never gonna eat at any of these places. Instead, why don't you write about the things you've eaten on your blog? You always feel like you don't write enough anyway.

To be honest, I never thought about writing on food. I had some wayward idea that I had to stuff my blog with technical discussions and "serious" thoughts, like Paul Graham, Linus Lee, etc. But yeesh, who am I if I take myself so seriously? Reliving great food is pleasurable and writing about it is a public service.

So I'm making this the first in a series of pieces about good eats. Coincidentally, this piece features three sandwiches (I love sandwiches). May it make you salivate ^_^

## Hydrolyzed Pea Protein
First up, a veggie burger you'd never catch me eating before cooking with a vegan roommate. I'm talking about a frozen Dr. Praeger's All-American patty, rich in chemicals, pea protein, and mystery. For all its American-ness, Dr. Praeger doesn't handle like the burger of Americana. Even though I'd thrown dozens of frozen patties on grills, I was thoroughly bamboozled. We burned most of the patties (it's all about the char, somebody opined). We also dropped one on the ground and artfully hid it among the good ones (Deven, I'm sorry you were in your room).

But despite the mystery patty, the delightful char, and the sleight of hand—we managed to slide each burger onto a squishy potato bun, top it with pickled jalapenos, tomatoes, onions, and homemade guac, and dab on some miso mayo. 

And in spite of all our incompetency, I tell you—that burger was among the best I've ever had. Fiery peppers, crisp interplay between the char and onion, and best of all, that popcorn-chicken savoriness of MSG from the patty...what can I say? Go buy some Dr. Praeger's.

## The Almost Greatest Sandwich in the World
The second memorable bite I had in October requires a little explanation. The world's greatest sandwich lives across from McDonald's global headquarters in a 6-seat, black-walled restaurant called Nonna's. The menu item in question is their Italian cold cut sandwich, which starts with 20 centimeters of good, rustic bread, succulent salami, tender ham, ripe tomatoes, and some crisp onions. To this they add giardiniera, a near-magical concoction of really good olive oil and pickled peppers. I'd punch somebody for this sandwich.

Naturally, I set out to replicate the sandwich. I already knew I could get quality cold cuts from Whole Foods. A month ago, I discovered a reasonable approximation of Nonna's giardiniera on Amazon. But this month, I discovered the Matt Cain at Ike's Love and Sandwiches. Minus the beef and plus the giardiniera, it tastes like Nonna's Californian cousin—a little sweeter, a little saucier, a little more stressed. Both giardiniera and Ike's have become part of my regular takeout budget.

## Do You Have Any Vegan Cookies Left?
My roommates and I lived on Northside last year. We were close to Chez Panisse but far from Southside—which is to say we were a 30-minute trek from civilization. As a result, we became worker bees, slaves to our ambition and mutual support. Two of us used to go dutifully to sleep at 10pm and wake up at 5am. 

This semester, we moved to our current apartment. And after recruitment for our respective clubs died down in mid-September, we decided it was time to exercise our newfound proximity to commercial America. We slipped out at 10:45 PM into a bitterly cold September night, ran the way to CREAM, and waited 10 minutes for their last batch of eggless cookies (Chai is vegan).

I remember the crackling of the wrapping and how my cookie sandwich felt like a rock (CREAM overbakes their cookies—to make good ice cream sandwiches, you've got to undercook them). The ice cream was cloyingly sweet, every bit the CREAM I remembered from freshman year. But it tasted like freedom, and we grinned like fools on the way back. Here, surely, was the kindred warmth we'd been missing all of last year.
