title: How the Hell Does Health Insurance Work?
---
## Context
American healthcare is *really* expensive. In 2017, we paid [$10739 per person](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/health-expenditures.htm), and spent [17.1% of our GDP](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SHA) on health expenses, a little under twice that of other other developed countries like Germany and the United Kingdom. And while these are aggregate figures that boggle the mind, we can always refer to an excellent [*New York Times* article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/27/upshot/expensive-health-care-world-comparison.html) for a visceral scare: a single knee replacement can cost upward of $30,000.

The reasons for this expense aren't easy to pin down. Even though it's not hard to say that drugs, physicians, and hospitals are all more expensive, their costs have been driven up by some combination of a risk-aversion, inefficient payer networks, and a free market. Good policy solutions are even harder to come by.

I'll probably write more about costs in future blog posts, but here I'll focus on the system that's evolved in response: health insurance. I hope that this post, which will cover how insurance works and common plans, will lend a little bit of clarity to your health as well.

<p class="message">Note: because insurance concepts are wordy, the market's come up with a lot of words to abstract complexity. Check out the last section for a list of useful vocab words.</p>

## The American Insurance System
In the health insurance market, there are three main characters: patients, payers, and providers. The story is what money flows where, and it generally looks something like this (please excuse the artistry):

</div>

The core idea is that you pay small premiums to an insurance company and the insurance company pays large fees to a hospital if something happens. This shields you from our obscene healthcare costs, while insurance companies that manage their risk right can make huge profits. Sounds simple, right?

Simple, yes, but the execution is complex. At the highest level, we can split coverage in the United States into four main categories: private direct-purchased, private employer-purchased, public Medicare, and public Medicaid. Here's a neat graph, courtesy of the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-267.pdf):

</div>

These four categories all execute on the same idea in different ways:
* Direct-purchased healthcare consists of individuals buying insurance from healthcare payers. This is usually expensive, and elements of the Affordable Care Act—aka Obamacare—intended to correct this.
* Employer-purchased healthcare gets directly deducted from salaries. Insurers like to make deals with employers because employees pay their premiums and those with jobs have lower risk (watch out high risk occupations though!).
* Medicare is funded by federal tax monies and covers services for those over 65.
* Medicaid is funded by an ever-changing combination of state and federal taxes and services primarily those with low incomes.

## Location, Content, Cost
Within the four areas, insurance plans vary even more. Some insurance plans designate hospital systems as being "in-network." This means that they've worked out sweet deals with them beforehand, and will be able to pay less for patient services. My insurance provider, for example, encourages me to go to hospitals in a 50-mile radius around home. This is especially relevant for away-from-home college students who are dependent on their parents' insurance.

Insurance plans also differ in what procedures they will actually cover. Payers are required by law to cover the following:
* Emergency services
* Hospitalization
* Laboratory tests
* Maternity and newborn care
* Mental health and substance-abuse treatment
* Outpatient care (doctors and other services you receive outside of a hospital)
* Pediatric services, including dental and vision care
* Prescription drugs
* Preventive services (e.g., some immunizations) and management of chronic diseases
* Rehabilitation services

...but do not universally cover brand-new treatments, dental/hearing/vision, or elective procedures, like travel vaccines and nursing home care.

Finally, insurance plans differ hugely in their out-of-pocket expenses. Plans with higher premiums will usually involve lower deductibles and copays. Insurers will enact higher annual coverage caps for insurance pools at higher risk. This, more than anything, is why it is well-worth it to have detailed knowledge of your insurance contract.

## Common Insurance Plans
Despite variability, most people are also limited in the category of healthcare coverage they can choose. Public payer plans have severe eligibility restrictions, while employer-based health plans generally decide on plans ahead of time. Your choice in health insurance will more likely be between one of the following "styles" of care. More information about these plans are readily available on Google, and I include them here just as a reference.

**Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)** plans are most common. They feature a (relatively large) network of providers and cover expenses out-of-network, albeit at a higher cost. While typically priced higher than competing plans, PPOs offer flexibility in that they require no primary care physician and no referrals to see a specialist.

**Healthcare Maintenance Organization (HMO)** plans are also very common. They tend to have narrower networks than PPOs, and will not cover out-of-network expenses at all, except in emergencies. HMOs also offer less flexibility: you are required to see a primary care physician before seeing any specialists. The catch is that HMOs are cheaper, and often provide better "lifetime wellness" services.
<p class="message">A particularly interesting model of HMO is Kaiser Permanente, which is an insurance company that bought its providers. This allows them to get really great provider prices, but you'll have to decide if that gives them a little too much influence in the Californian health market.</p>

**Point of Service (POS)** plans are more expensive HMOs that require PCPs while allowing out-of-network service.

**HSA Health Plans** are PPO plans specifically geared toward health savings accounts. Much like educational and retirement accounts, these accounts allow patients to wing taxes for expenses incurred.

## Conclusion and Further Reading
I have often wondered how and why such a complex payer system evolved in the United States. Complexity in insurance definitely derives in part from complexity in our provider systems themselves. Since American healthcare distinguishes itself from other developed countries through a large, private marketplace and concentrated lobbying, all of this bureaucratic complexity may, surprisingly, be the result of free market forces.

But enough with the speculation for now; I anticipate exploring this topic in significantly more depth in the future. If you've read this far, I'm grateful—may this serve as a reference for your health. I also urge you to  invest some time into thinking about how to understand and improve our broken healthcare system, if only because it will dominate American spending in years to come.

## Reference: Vocabulary
Here's a glossary of all of the sawdust in this blog post:
* **Out-of-pocket expenses** are the medical expenses that you pay, including deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance.
* Your **deductible** is how much you pay before your insurance jumps in and starts helping you out. Insurance companies typically present deductibles by year; if your annual deductible were $2000, you would pay the first $2000 in medical expenses you incur that year.
* You incur a **copayment/copay** when you get a medical procedure. Think of this as cash upfront—like $30 at the doctor's office after a checkup.
* Your **coinsurance** is the percentage of medical costs you are responsible for.
* Often, your insurance company will have **formularies**, which are lists of medications covered.
* Your **(annual) out-of-pocket maximum** is the sum of your copays, coinsurance, and deductible, beyond which your insurance company will pay for 100% of **covered costs**, which are services that are included in your insurance contract.
* **Payers** are those who are bearing the brunt of healthcare costs, be it private insurers, or the government.
* **Providers** include hospitals, laboratories, clinics—anywhere that provides care.
* Required by HMOs and some other plans, **primary care physicians (PCPs)** are today's "family doctors." They refer you to specialists, oversee routine checkups, and make decisions for testing.
