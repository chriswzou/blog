<p class="message">
  Hey there! I'm Chris Zou, a junior at <a href="https://berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> studying Computer Science and Molecular Biology. I'm currently building a MongoDB integration for <a href="https://github.com/rdkit">rdkit</a>, an open-source chemoinformatics platform, and serving as a department tutor for <a href="https://cs61bl.org/su20/">CS61BL: Data Structures</a>.
</p>

More generally, I want to improve lives with technology. While leading projects with [Neurotech@Berkeley](https://neurotech.berkeley.edu) and [Phoenix Consulting Group](https://phoenix.berkeley.edu), I got exposure to digital health products, data-driven health policy, brain computer-interfacing, and using holography for imaging. Especially in healthcare, there's limitless possibility. We're like the Seahawks at the 1-yard line. All we have to do is make the right play.

Outside of tech and healthcare, I've spent some time selling an [app](https://choco.com) to chefs in Chicago and [advocating for access](http://www.peerprivatelessons.org/) to music lessons. These days, I spend a lot of time running and writing, some of the latter on this site.

Whether about tech, healthcare, a job, or interesting ideas, I'd love to get in touch with you at [cwzou@berkeley.edu](mailto: cwzou@berkeley.edu). More information below:
