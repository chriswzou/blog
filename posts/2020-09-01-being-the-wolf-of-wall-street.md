title: Trying to be the Wolf of Wall Street

<p class="message">All names are fictitious, but the stories behind them are real.</p>
During the summer of 2019, I worked as a Venture Development Intern for Choco. Choco is a sustainability startup. They have an ambitious vision to disrupt the food supply industry, which is rife with inefficiencies and waste. I was similarly ambitious (and naive). After a year of being in the Bay Area, I was caught up in my first CS classes and what seemed like limitless possibility for doing good with tech. I would work my ass off in a couple of startups, get to know some co-founders, and build a company that would eliminate all the planet's evils.
