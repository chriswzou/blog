title: Our Most Important Things
---
For her 51st birthday, Mom asked me to tell her what three things I thought were most important to her and why.

That's easy, I thought. Her kids, her husband, and...what? Her friends? Her job? Her parents? I was taken aback, because it seemed like the number three had stumped me. What if she'd asked me to name five?

After a little bit more thinking, I realized what was actually bothering me: my notion of what was important to Mom first associated with *physical objects* and used them to extrapolate values. On the other hand, all of the things I consider most important are *intangible values* that influence how I interact with physical things.

The simplest explanation was that we can't get in each other's heads, so we infer each others' values based on how we see them interact with the world around them. Certainly, this rang true for my understanding of Mom. Since 95% of my interactions with her were on the way to a lesson or during mealtimes, I inferred my family and I were the most important things in her life. And as soon as I found out that wasn't the *whole* truth, I was off to college.

A sobering theory, to be sure: it implied—implies—that my understanding of others was limited by the contexts in which I spent time with them. Spend time with somebody at a club and you'll think of them as a partier; spend time with somebody in lab and you'll think of them as academically motivated. It's only very strong alternate observations that tip the scales.

At the same time, I certainly hadn't limited my own values in such a way.

My knowledge of Mom could certainly be limited in this way. Chinese parenting culture anonymizes the parents, affording them little room to express personal desire. Since 95% of my interactions with Mom were on the way to a lesson or during mealtimes at home, I inferred that I was most important things in her life. And as soon as I found out that wasn't the *whole* truth, I was off to college.

Mom's three most important things:
1. 


















I don't think it's bad for kids to think this; in fact, it's probably really great for development. And we weren't wrong. Our parents prioritized us a lot. But we were still surprised when we found out our parents were independently-minded people like us, capable of caring about politics and asking questions like the one Mom asked me. And by that time

We weren't totally wrong, but surprise! It wasn't until we were well into our late teens that we found out our parents were independently-minded people like us.






Since Dad was the breadwinner and Mom the driver, my brother and I inferred growing up was that Dad wanted to do well at work, and Mom wanted us to do well in competitions.





My case was a little bit different—my brother and I found out very early on that my Dad really desires scientific achievement—


Since Dad was the breadwinner and Mom the driver, what my brother and I inferred growing up was that


my parents worked to pay, took me to lessons, and whisked us on vacations, all with very little inclination toward their


My brother and I had grown up seeing my parents only infrequently as people, because Chinese parenting culture is fundamentally self-sacrificing: your parents pay for school, take you to lessons,


 parents as an extension of the universe's will, not thinking people. Consequently, it was a little strange—and fun—trying to get inside Mom's head.






An interesting and difficult question, to be sure. If I asked the same of myself, I'd generate a laundry list of things that I treasure (family, influence, relationships, etc.). I'd list these in "standard cultural order," placing money somewhere near the bottom and relationships near the top.

Yet I've foregone hangouts to meet deadlines and forgotten gifts because I sometimes take my family for granted. My behavior isn't consistent. Maybe my list isn't as well-prioritized as I'd believe, or I don't stick to my values.







Yet I've foregone birthday celebrations to meet deadlines and forgotten gifts because I take my family for granted. My behavior is inconsistent with a well-prioritized laundry list. This means my list isn't well-prioritized or it is but I don't stick to my values, both bad things.


Our hearts are where the treasure is, so if we aren't consistent with what we care about, we won't

If you were to ask me the same one, I'd give you a messy laundry list (love, money, power, )
