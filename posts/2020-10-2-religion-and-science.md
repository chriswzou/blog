title: Can Science Cast Doubt on Religion?
---
<p class="message">This is Part I of an intended series examining contemporary Christianity. Since I've lived life inside and outside the church, many pieces draw on personal experience. I'd ask the reader to keep in mind that religion, science, and all their mysteries far exceed my life (and Christianity). Take each piece as a reflection—an invitation to deeper discussion.</p>

## Introduction
Before science, reality was a mystery. We saw the wondrous in a sea shell and heard anger in thunder and lightning. For Christians, reality's explanation was God: loving, omnipotent, a heavenly father in the night sky.

Then science grew up—and for better or worse, in the West first. For all Christianity tried to explain, it couldn't predict heredity, cure ills, or grow crops. The universe, it seemed, wasn't made in 6 days. The success of science promoted methodological naturalism and disbelief in miracles, Biblical or otherwise. Modern nations separated religion and state, and the church gradually transformed into what it is today: an explanation of morality and by extension, human relationships and society.

Partly because science emerged in a Christian environment, Christianity developed a rich history of apologetics (defending the faith). I'm talking about "debates" between Christian theologists and scientists, where apologists "use" science to argue for the existence of God. I have found few of these arguments convincing, and the scientific community at large sees the fight as mostly over. God may or may not exist, but absence of evidence is evidence of absence.

Modern Christianity now takes the stance that science cannot speak definitively on God—ever—because science and religion concern themselves with completely different questions. Stephen Jay Gould:

“The net of science covers the empirical universe: what is it made of (fact) and why does it work this way (theory). The net of religion extends over questions of moral meaning and value… Since evolution made us the only earthly creatures with advanced consciousness, what responsibilities are so entailed for our relations with other species? What do our genealogical ties with other organisms imply about the meaning of human life?”

Believing this means acknowledging that Christianity and science are bodies of knowledge that can't interact at some deep level. It also means that religion is *necessary*, since there are questions that science cannot answer. In truth, interplay at the border between science and religion is fast and fierce. Christian apologists have enlisted scientific theories to argue for intelligent design. Atheists use evolutionary psychology to explain morality without God. 

## Asking the Wrong Questions
I want to note that first, science is a methodology. Christianity usually refers to a belief system—a body of knowledge. 





At first glance, this seems perfectly reasonable. It’s impractical to generate an experiment to answer questions about the meaning of human life. Science does seem to explain the how, not the why. Yet a glance at the Old Testament reveals curious parallels between the scientific method and Jewish faith:

“And God said, ‘I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.’” (Exodus 3:12, NIV)

God seems to ask Moses to assert that it is God who is with him, which more or less is a hypothesis. God then tells Moses to look for a sign—perform an experiment—and gives him a prediction of the results should the hypothesis be true, making the hypothesis falsifiable. In fact, this pattern of thinking reappears again and again throughout the Bible: Jesus asserts his identity as the Messiah by fulfilling prophecy and ultimately blows away his disciples’ doubt by fulfilling his own experiment: rising from the dead. 

What’s going on here? Careful readers will notice that the claims made in Exodus and the Gospels seem to be different from the abstract claim “the meaning of life is ——.” Both Moses and the disciples expected to see a physically measurable faith. This kind of faith is easily subject to testing via the generalization of the scientific method described above. 

Indeed, Christian apologists already do this when they argue for the reality of the Resurrection, the historicity of the Bible, or the existence of God. It appears, then, that we cannot restrict Science to the natural world (and it would be absurd to do so, considering we use the same method of inquiry into human behavior and economics already). In fact, I think that the natural sciences are just one of many fields that use a variation of the following framework:

1.	We interact with reality by observing it. However, since reality is far larger than what we observe, we only ever have beliefs about a small portion of reality, and our confidence in those beliefs should never be absolute. 
2.	Our beliefs are what we use to predict observations. 
3.	We give each belief a degree of confidence, represented by our perceived probability of observing an event X. 
4.	Upon observation of reality, we update our beliefs by adding new ones or changing the probabilities for old ones. 

What are the other fields? Law, history, apologetics, cooking, you name it—anywhere there’s uncertainty and people are trying to figure out the truth (which is to say basically everywhere). While my exploration here is not rigorous, I seriously challenge you to find one belief you acquired without using this framework or something similar to it. If we take this framework to be shared between theists and atheists, there are a couple of important implications.

First, the belief “God exists” is the same kind of claim as “the weather will be sunny tomorrow”—namely that we believe it with a certain probability and it predicts our observations. If this probability is below 50%, then we think there’s a greater likelihood He doesn’t exist than vice versa, so theists are those who believe P(God exists) > 0.5, and atheists are those who believe P(God exists) < 0.5.

Second, the probability for any belief—including “God exists”—is changeable and should change according to new information. This follows from (2) above, or alternatively, the falsification condition that God gave to Moses. Since our beliefs are what we use to predict our experiences, our beliefs must constrain our anticipations in specific ways. Beliefs that don’t have predictions attached to them don’t mean much at all. 

A good way of testing this is the following thought experiment: 

If you believe in God, what would make the probability of God existing go down for you? Aliens revealing the sky is a simulation? Debunking irreducible complexity? A strong and compelling argument that proteins can self-assemble? If you don’t, what might lead you to change your belief? A bearded man in a white robe appearing in front of you? A Christian performing a miracle? It’s important to recognize that you cannot change your predictions when confronted by reality—that’d be like ignoring data in science.

The second statement implies a third—that we can and already do generate probabilities for a lot of theistic claims based off of available evidence. For instance, many theists claim that science can neither prove nor disprove God. This might still be true, in the sense that even in formal systems, there are things we definitively can’t prove or disprove (@Godel), but it doesn’t mean much. Our beliefs about God don’t lie in an isolated formal system; they are part of our probabilistic guesses about the world.

Now there is a question that we haven’t answered. What about the belief “the meaning of life is to love God and others and spread the Gospel?” How do you probabilistically believe anything about an assertion like that? How do you make predictions?

The reason why this assertion is difficult to think about is not because it is so different, but because its language is vague. Very few people have an exact idea of what they mean when they say “the meaning of life.” Will those who are serving the true meaning of life be more fulfilled? Less sin? Will it lead to rewards in heaven?

Any of these statements causes the statement to collapse into something prediction-based and testable. We can empirically test, though not without difficulty, whether those serving a Christian mission are more satisfied or happy longitudinally than those serving in a Buddhist temple. We can examine at a societal level whether Christian communities have less conflict than non-Christian ones. Anticipating a reward in heaven is to anticipate a God, which is again a testable belief based on claims about God’s behavior (miracles, the Resurrection), or the nature of physics. 

Now philosophers have pointed out that some statements do not immediately constrain our anticipations. What, for example, are our responsibilities for relations with other species? Here it is necessary to peruse metaethics and choose a moral code. And yet I personally find it difficult to disentangle this from yet more predictions: if we do not, for example, anticipate some sort of divine judgement, maximal utility, or existential satisfaction as a result of choice, why should we choose one moral over the other?

“The net of science covers the empirical universe: what is it made of (fact) and why does it work this way (theory). The net of religion extends over questions of moral meaning and value… “

Perhaps a better way to say this is instead that science and religion are both elements that seek truth, though one deals primarily with physical phenomena and the other with morals. Both make use of the same, deeper framework for finding their answers, and both are preoccupied with more accurate beliefs and more accurate predictions. If they both enforce predictions on the same reality, why do theists claim that religion is non-disprovable and atheists that science ought to automatically dismiss religious claims?

The motivation for separation might lie somewhere farther from reality and closer to politics. Gould writes that creating an artificial divide “permits—indeed enjoins—the prospect of respectful discourse, of constant input from both magisteria toward the common goal of wisdom.” Another way of saying this: parties of religion and science pose no threat to the other’s beliefs. Yet it seems to me this is at best a holding action, one that deflects both sides away from reconciliation and toward an even stronger ideological tilt. Counterproductive for two disciplines that claim to serve truth, but maybe it is just that hard to admit that one is wrong.
