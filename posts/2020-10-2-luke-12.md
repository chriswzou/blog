title: Death and Dreams
---
Outline:
- Luke 12 reveals a terrible truth:
we don't choose when we die

But what does it mean from a secular standpoint?

A Christian would reply that you must plan for eternity.

"Poorer than the poorest beggar" he left the world.

So how do people make peace with this?

Does it mean that we should give up our dreams? Does it mean that we shouldn't try to acquire personal wealth?

Should we all live as if we are going to die tomorrow? Does it mean that we should only, as Steve Jobs says, do things that we would do if we were going to die tomorrow?

But we have to plan for the future. Otherwise our plans don't really work.

What is this Christian attitude toward death?

So the Christian thesis generalized is that we should consider our existential issues.

But for those of us who don't believe in the Christian existential issue, what does that mean?

The capital T Truth of life is life before death. Since death is certain.
